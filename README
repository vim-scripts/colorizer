A modification of css_color.vim (vimscript #2150). It highlights all color strings in the form of #rrggbb or #rgb, regardless of file types, and unlike css_color.vim, it's able to find all colors in one line. It has support for 256-color terminals. It won't highlight color names.

This plugin defines three commands:

	ColorHighlight	- start/update highlighting
	ColorClear      - clear all highlights
	ColorToggle     - toggle highlights

By default, <leader>tc is mapped to ColorToggle. If you want to use another
key map, do like this:
	nmap ,tc <Plug>Colorizer

If you want completely not to map it, set the following in your vimrc:
      let g:colorizer_nomap = 1

To use solid color highlight, set this in your vimrc (later change won't
probably take effect unless you use ':ColorHighlight!' to force update):
      let g:colorizer_fgcontrast = -1
set it to 0 or 1 to use a softened foregroud color.

Note: if you modify a color string in normal mode, if the cursor is still on
that line, it'll take 'updatetime' seconds to update. You can use
:ColorHighlight (or your key mapping) again to force update.

Performace Notice: In terminal, it may take several seconds to highlight 240
different colors. GUI version is much quicker.
